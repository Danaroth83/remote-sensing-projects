## Project Organization

The following folder structure serves as a guideline to standardize the project
structure across different groups and across different academic years.

------------
    project            <- Root folder of your project. Do not add or change any 
    │                     file outside this folder.  
    ├───data           <- Contains a subset of the data, with relatively small  
    │                     size (<10 MB), to run a demo of your script.  
    ├───docs           <- Contains the official documentation related to the  
    │                     dataset, methods, etc.  
    ├───notebooks      <- Contains the Jupyter notebooks to present how to use  
    │                     the code from src  
    ├── reports        <- Contains reports and presentation  
    ├── 2021_2022      <- Contains the reports and presentation relative to the  
    │   │                 specific academic year, and exclusively produced by
    │   │                 your workgroup.  
    │   └───figures    <- Raw figures that you generated for your reports  
    └───src            <- Contains the source code in Python for the specific  
                          project. Ideally to be expanded upon each year.
